# (future) BioPAX site 

http://biopax.github.io

The BioPAX.org web site lived at CBIO MSKCC until 2013.
Then, it was moved to the BioPAX project on Sourceforge (project-web, 
accessible via biopax.sf.net), and its configuration and core pages were 
saved in [the Mercurial repository](http://hg.code.sf.net/p/biopax/site).

BioPAX.org still resides on Sourceforge (www.biopax.org, biopax.org = biopax.sf.net).

Once we come up with a new design (not using .htaccess and PHP) 
and relocate or remove some of exisiting content, such as old wiki, 
file downloads, Maven-generated documentation (Paxtools' and Validator's), 
Maven repositories, and update the DNS configuration, 
the new BioPAX site will be probably hosted here on GitHub.
