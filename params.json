Specifically, BioPAX supports data exchange between pathway data groups and thus reduces the complexity of interchange between data formats by providing an accepted standard format for pathway data. It is an open and collaborative effort by the community of researchers, software developers, and institutions. BioPAX is defined in [OWL DL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) and is represented in the RDF/XML format. [BioPAX Paper](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n9/full/nbt.1666.html) was published in Nature Biotechnology in 2010.\r\n\r\n## \"Hello World\" example:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<rdf:RDF\r\n xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\"\r\n xmlns:owl=\"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\"\r\n xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\r\n xmlns:bp=\"http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#\" xml:base=\"\">\r\n<owl:Ontology rdf:about=\"\">\r\n <owl:imports rdf:resource=\"http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#\" />\r\n</owl:Ontology>\r\n  <bp:Protein rdf:about=\"http://my.example.com/biopax#HelloWorld\">\r\n    <bp:displayName rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">Hello World!</bp:displayName>\r\n  </bp:Protein>\r\n</rdf:RDF>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Links:\r\n* BioPAX ontology and documentation [releases](http://www.biopax.org/release/)\r\n* BioPAX secification [sub-project](https://github.com/BioPAX/specification)\r\n* BioPAX model [examples](https://github.com/BioPAX/specification/blob/master/Level3/examples/)\r\n* BioPAX [archive and downloads](http://www.biopax.org/downloads/biopax/)\r\n \r\n## PS:\r\nOfficial BioPAX web site www.biopax.org has been at CBIO MSKCC until 2013; \r\nthen it moved to Sourceforge (Project-Web hosting, biopax.sf.net) and still resides there. \r\nSite configuration and some static content are stored in the Hg [repository](http://hg.code.sf.net/p/biopax/site).\r\nAnd we are thinking of a better design (not using .htaccess, MediaWiki and PHP) and migrating here.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nBioPAX team.\r\n","google":"UA-43341809-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
